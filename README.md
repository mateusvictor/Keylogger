# Keylogger C/C++

A simple keylogger that register the key and the time in a file .txt. (If the file doesn't exist, the program (main.exe) creates one.)

The keylogger is called silently by a file .bat (run.bat) that runs a Chrome Browser. 
In addiction, the .bat file is called every time the .vbs is executed. 

In other words, every time the file .vbs (or you can just add a shortcut and change the icon for a better trap) is executed, the keylogger is incicialized, just being possible to stop it ending the process in the Task Manager or restarting the system.
